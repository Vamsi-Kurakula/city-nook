# Core Idea
## Project Overview

City Crawler is a location-based adventure app that transforms urban exploration into interactive experiences. The app features specialized "crawls" throughout Chicago, offering two distinct types of adventures:

### Crawl Types

1. **Traditional Bar Crawls**: Users navigate from location to location, following a curated route through the city's best spots.

2. **Puzzle-Based Adventures**: Escape room-style experiences where users must solve riddles, complete challenges, or find clues to unlock the next location.

## Development Approach

- **Initial Phase**: All crawls will be designed and curated by myself to ensure quality experiences
- **Future Vision**: User-generated content platform where anyone can easily create and share their own custom crawls


# Target Users
The inital target user would be people who want to explore Chicago in a different way, as anyone could just look up cool places to go, the gamified, escape room-style approach adds an element of discovery and achievement that traditional exploration methods lack, making city exploration more engaging and memorable.


# Tech Stack
The app is intended to run on mobile, so I am using react native to code the whole thing. Similar to the partiful app, I would also want a similar web experieence for users, so they do not have to install anything. However, that is something I would tackle later!

# Key Features

## Crawl Library
The app will launch with 4-7 pre-loaded crawls, each designed to showcase different interactive features.

## Crawl Types & Features

**Traditional Bar Crawls:**
- Seamless location-to-location navigation
- Clear directions and venue information

**Interactive Adventure Crawls:**
- **Text-based puzzles**: Riddles and word challenges that unlock next locations
- **Photo challenges**: Capture specific landmarks or moments to progress
- **Location verification**: GPS-based confirmation when users reach designated spots

## User Profile & Progress Tracking
- **Crawl History**: View all completed adventures with completion dates
- **Progress Management**: Resume partially completed crawls from where you left off
- **Achievement Tracking**: Monitor your exploration progress and milestones


# Initial Scope
The inital scope will target more text based puzzles rather than photo and location puzzles. However, if time permits, I will attempt to do the other puzzle types. 

# 5 Week Plan
## Week 1 
Currently in week 1. I have been focused on figuring out the tecnical aspects of the application. I have been working with curor on building a simple app version of the idea, no aestetics have been fully built out, but can we solve a series of riddle based puzzles and get a series directions on where to go next.

## Week 2
This week I will attempt to finalize the MVP of the above features and start to work on the aesthetics.

## Week 3
Further refining the aesthetics and then play testing this alpha version with a couple of friends to get some feedback on how to make the app more usable and the gameplay more fun. 

## Week 4
Depending on the past few weeks, this week may be either about continuing to refine both the UI/UX/inital features or this week may be starting to work on new features more on user profiles or mor advanced puzzles


## Week 5
Hopefully by this week a beta version will be ready and we can work on figuring out what is the best value to work on going forward.
