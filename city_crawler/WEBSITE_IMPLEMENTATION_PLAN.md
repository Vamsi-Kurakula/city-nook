# Website Implementation Plan for City Crawler

This document outlines the steps required to convert the City Crawler mobile app into a fully functional website, maintaining the same design language, backend connectivity, and user experience, while optimizing for web and wider screens.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- **Choose a Web Framework:**
  - Recommended: [React](https://react.dev/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)) for fast prototyping and component reuse.
  - Consider [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for SSR/SEO if public crawl sharing or discoverability is important.
- **Monorepo or Separate Repo:**
  - Decide whether to keep mobile and web in a monorepo (for shared code) or separate repositories.
- **Initialize Project:**
  - Set up TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and other tooling for consistency.

---

## 2. Codebase Refactoring for Web

- **Component Reuse:**
  - Audit existing React Native components for logic that can be shared (business logic, hooks, context, utils).
  - Move shared logic to a `shared/` or `common/` directory.
- **UI Layer:**
  - Replace React Native components (`View`, `Text`, etc.) with web equivalents (`div`, `span`, etc.) or use [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) for easier migration.
  - Rebuild custom UI components for web, matching the mobile design system.
- **Navigation:**
  - Replace React Navigation with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) or Next.js routing.
- **Assets:**
  - Ensure all images, icons, and fonts are web-compatible and optimized.

## 3. Responsive Design & UX

- **Responsive Layouts:**
  - Use CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries to adapt layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
  - Adjust navigation (e.g., sidebars for desktop, bottom tabs for mobile).
- **Component Responsiveness:**
  - Refactor screens and components to gracefully expand on wider screens (e.g., multi-column layouts, modals, side panels).
- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and color contrast meet accessibility standards.
- **Touch vs. Click:**
  - Adjust interactions for mouse/keyboard (hover states, focus rings) in addition to touch.

---

## 4. Backend Integration

- **API Layer:**
  - Reuse or adapt the existing API client for web (fetch/axios, error handling, auth flows).
  - Ensure CORS is enabled on the backend for web requests.
- **Authentication:**
  - Adapt sign-in/sign-up flows for web (consider OAuth popups, cookies, or JWT in localStorage).
- **Database:**
  - No changes needed if backend is already API-driven and database-agnostic.

---

## 5. Feature Parity & Testing

- **Screen-by-Screen Audit:**
  - List all mobile screens and features; ensure each is implemented on web.
- **Testing:**
  - Write unit and integration tests for new web components.
  - Perform cross-browser and device testing.
- **Manual QA:**
  - Test all user flows (sign in, crawl, progress, history, etc.) on web.

---

## 6. Deployment & Hosting

- **Choose Hosting:**
  - Options: Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, or traditional web hosting.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Set up web-specific environment variables for API endpoints, keys, etc.
- **CI/CD:**
  - Configure automated builds, tests, and deployments.

---

## 7. Post-Launch

- **Analytics:**
  - Integrate Google Analytics or similar for usage tracking.
- **SEO:**
  - Add meta tags, Open Graph, and sitemap for discoverability (especially if using SSR).
- **User Feedback:**
  - Add feedback forms or bug reporting tools.

---

## 8. Optional: Progressive Web App (PWA)

- **PWA Enhancements:**
  - Add service worker for offline support.
  - Enable installability and home screen shortcuts.
