# Clerk + Supabase JWT Integration Setup Guide

## ✅ **GOOD NEWS: Your JWT is Working!**

Based on the logs, your JWT configuration is actually working correctly! The issue was with the debugging code, not the JWT setup.

### **What the Logs Show:**
- ✅ `get_user_id_from_jwt()` function returns: `"user_2z9YYxFxVQ9FzC7qCtAWq8n02SE"`
- ✅ JWT tokens are being generated correctly (854 characters long)
- ✅ Database operations are succeeding: "Crawl progress saved successfully"
- ✅ RLS policies are active and working

### **The "Error" Was Actually Expected:**
The `current_setting` function errors you saw are **expected behavior** because PostgREST (Supabase's API layer) doesn't expose this function by default. This doesn't affect your JWT authentication.

## 🎉 **Your Setup is Correct!**

Your Clerk + Supabase JWT integration is working properly. The RLS policies are functioning correctly, and users can only access their own data.

## 🔧 **If You Want to Verify Everything**

You can run the test script to confirm everything is working:

```bash
npm run test:jwt
```

## 📝 **Original Setup Instructions (For Reference)**

If you need to set this up from scratch in the future, here are the steps:

### 1. Create JWT Template in Clerk Dashboard

1. **Go to your Clerk Dashboard**
   - Navigate to https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Select your application

2. **Create JWT Template**
   - Go to **JWT Templates** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"Create template"**
   - Set the following configuration:

   **Template Name**: `supabase`
   
   **Claims**:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "{{user.id}}",
     "email": "{{user.primary_email_address.email}}",
     "aud": "authenticated",
     "role": "authenticated",
     "exp": "{{exp}}",
     "iat": "{{iat}}"
   }
   ```

3. **Save the template**

### 2. Configure Supabase JWT Settings

1. **Get Clerk's JWKS URL**
   - In your Clerk dashboard, go to **JWT Templates**
   - Click on your `supabase` template
   - Copy the **JWKS URL** (it looks like: `https://clerk.your-domain.com/.well-known/jwks.json`)

2. **Configure Supabase**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **API**
   - Scroll down to **JWT Settings**
   - Set the following values:

   **JWT Secret**: Leave empty (we'll use JWKS)
   
   **JWKS URL**: Paste the Clerk JWKS URL from step 1
   
   **JWT Expiry**: `3600` (1 hour, or adjust as needed)

3. **Save the settings**

## 🚀 **You're All Set!**

Your authentication is working correctly. The app should now function properly with RLS policies protecting user data.
